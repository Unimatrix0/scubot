# scubot
Bot for /r/scuba Discord

## Usage
Before starting the bot up, make sure to set up a bot account first! You can do that in the Developer section on Discord's website. Bots using a user account are against Discord's Terms of Service!

Once you have that, take your bot account's Token and put it into a file named `token` in the same directory as `bot.py`.

Included are a few simple modules that are considered to be core functionality for a bot. If you want to make your own, [read more about modules here](modules/aboutmodules.md).
